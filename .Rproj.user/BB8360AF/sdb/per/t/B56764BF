Lookinto using SMOTE to balance classes for earnings declines/misses\n\n. Check code and data pull (esp macro variables: are they matched right?, fiscal year end fyear matching)\n. compute accruals using cf method\n. Use indicator variables relative to industry\n. Add R&D, high-low accruals, share buybacks and dividends, equity issuance (F-score variables)\n. Add industry average earnings lags as predictors (cf Cyert (1967) and Williams (1967))\n. Limit to firms with sufficient quarters to estimate regression(sacrifice some external validity)\n. have reg model choose in-sample based on AIC/AdjR-squared via stepwise\n. check delisting reasons (potentially excluded acquired firms)\n. make use of Z-score\n. trading strategy\n. prepare table of average multivariable regression coefficients by industry\n. check bias of analyst forecasts, other properties\n. evaluate by number of years available for estimation, dec year-end\n. add AR(1) to all evaluation reports\n. check performance by ex-ante uncertainty (historical earnings volatility)\n. incorporate mgmt guidance\n. get macro variables for fy2 and fy3 forecasts\n. Check post-Reg FD split\n. Check subsample in which there is high analyst dispersion (disagreement)\n. compare forecast accuracy over time (by fyear)\n. multivariate model building\n. merge analyst fy2 and fy3 forecasts with stat forecasts\n. compare summary stats to literature\n. log total assets\n. univariate tests\n. Correlation matrix\n. Compute summary stats \n. Deal with outliers, missingness (winsorize at 1/99)\n. Add more actual lags\n. Try limiting to long-lived firms (15+ years)\n\nNOT GONNA DO\n. Try MA(1) term\n* Extend data past IBES coverage period\n\nNOTES\n* Take a sample of blue chip firms (GE, IBM, MCD), get their quarterly earnings and associated\nanalyst forecasts. Do the forecasting procedure in Lorek and Pagach (2014) to get predictions of \none-year-ahead earnings. Augment with macro, accounting, and stock price data. Evaluate against \nanalyst forecasts 11 months out (ie, forecasts of next year's EPS right after this year's is \nannounced.) Evaluate trading strategy based on 1-, 3-, and 5-year buy-and-hold returns.\n\n* Consider EPS growth instead of EPS level. More likely to follow an AR(1).\n\n* Take a sample of blue chip firms (GE, IBM, MCD), get their annual earnings and associated analyst \nforecasts. Augment forecast with macro, accounting, and stock price data.

(Market \nthis as a feature, not a bug.)\n* Exclude firms whose firms are negative over the entire observation period\n* Utilities and financials are excluded\\\n* Compute current assets as CASH + RECEIVABLES + INVENTORIES\n* GDP: Use nominal, quarterly, seasonally adjusted, year-over-year change in GDP. For forecasting,\nuse the gdp figure from the quarter prior to that in which the analyst forecast (as indicated by \nstatpers). STATPERS_GDP_QTR = 4, indicates use the gdp figure from the fourth quarter of the \nPREVIOUS year, STATPERS_GDP_QTR = 1 indicates use the gdp figure from the 1st quarter of that year,\nand so on.\n* Unemployment: Use the unemployment rate from the month prior to the month in which the analyst \nmade the forecast\n* Accruals calculated using the balance sheet approach (eg Sloan [1996])\n",
