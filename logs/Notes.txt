TODO
. impute cshoq
. compute quarterly ratios
. first run of regression models
. split sample
. second run of modeling and out-of-sample validation (don't look at results, just make sure code works)
. Lookinto using SMOTE to balance classes for earnings declines/misses

. Check code and data pull (esp macro variables: are they matched right?, fiscal year end fyear matching)
. compute accruals using cf method
. Use indicator variables relative to industry
. Add R&D, high-low accruals, share buybacks and dividends, equity issuance (F-score variables)
. Add industry average earnings lags as predictors (cf Cyert (1967) and Williams (1967))
. Limit to firms with sufficient quarters to estimate regression(sacrifice some external validity)
. have reg model choose in-sample based on AIC/AdjR-squared via stepwise
. check delisting reasons (potentially excluded acquired firms)
. make use of Z-score
. trading strategy
. prepare table of average multivariable regression coefficients by industry
. check bias of analyst forecasts, other properties
. evaluate by number of years available for estimation, dec year-end
. add AR(1) to all evaluation reports
. check performance by ex-ante uncertainty (historical earnings volatility)
. incorporate mgmt guidance
. get macro variables for fy2 and fy3 forecasts
. Check post-Reg FD split
. Check subsample in which there is high analyst dispersion (disagreement)
. compare forecast accuracy over time (by fyear)
. multivariate model building
. merge analyst fy2 and fy3 forecasts with stat forecasts
. compare summary stats to literature
. log total assets
. univariate tests
. Correlation matrix
. Compute summary stats 
. Deal with outliers, missingness (winsorize at 1/99)
. Add more actual lags
. Try limiting to long-lived firms (15+ years)

NOT GONNA DO
. Try MA(1) term
* Extend data past IBES coverage period

NOTES
* Take a sample of blue chip firms (GE, IBM, MCD), get their quarterly earnings and associated
analyst forecasts. Do the forecasting procedure in Lorek and Pagach (2014) to get predictions of 
one-year-ahead earnings. Augment with macro, accounting, and stock price data. Evaluate against 
analyst forecasts 11 months out (ie, forecasts of next year's EPS right after this year's is 
announced.) Evaluate trading strategy based on 1-, 3-, and 5-year buy-and-hold returns.

* Consider EPS growth instead of EPS level. More likely to follow an AR(1).

	* Macro: gdp, pct chg in gdp, unemployment, headline and core inflation (cpi, ppi)
	* sp500, own stock price, yoy change in stock price, PE ratio
	* accounting
		* raw: assets, accruals,   earnings, dividends
		* ratios: ROE, ROA, RNOA
	* other: industry factors?
	* Add MA(1) term
	
* Uses of earnings forecast: 
	* evaluate based on MSE, MAE, bias
	* trading strategy
	* icc
	* estimating equity risk premium

* Separately handle firms that are likely to go bankrupt next year (Altman's Z-score?)

Differences from Hou et al
* augmented model with macro data
* augmented model with fundamental ratios (eg ROE)
* firm-level regressions
* use IBES eps for forecasting

* Include a case-study in modeling and forecasting earnings and trading on the forecast (eg GOOG)
	* start with graph, then AR(1) and analyst forecasts, add growth, macro, acct data
	
DATA TREATMNET
* Drop firms with gaps in earnings data (TODO: handle this better!)
* Exclude small cap firms (MV<1bn)
* Limited to firms with at least 15 years of earnings history in the sample period (~20%). (Market 
this as a feature, not a bug.)
* Exclude firms whose firms are negative over the entire observation period
* Utilities and financials are excluded\
* Compute current assets as CASH + RECEIVABLES + INVENTORIES
* GDP: Use nominal, quarterly, seasonally adjusted, year-over-year change in GDP. For forecasting,
use the gdp figure from the quarter prior to that in which the analyst forecast (as indicated by 
statpers). STATPERS_GDP_QTR = 4, indicates use the gdp figure from the fourth quarter of the 
PREVIOUS year, STATPERS_GDP_QTR = 1 indicates use the gdp figure from the 1st quarter of that year,
and so on.
* Unemployment: Use the unemployment rate from the month prior to the month in which the analyst 
made the forecast
* Accruals calculated using the balance sheet approach (eg Sloan [1996])
