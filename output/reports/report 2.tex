%Short motivation. Short research question. Short contribution. Short conclusion.
Analyst 
forecasts are used in research  on valuation, cost of capital, and more. In this paper I deconstruct
this supposed advantage of analysts over statistical forecasts. I develop and evaluate a novel
statistical forecasting framework for earnings. I reinterpret and reevaluate estimates of firms' 
implied cost of capital and market-level risk premia that rely on analyst forecasts by using a 
statistical forecast. I examine if the main strength of the purported superioty of analyst forecasts
is concentrated in the period prior to the passage of Regulation Fair Disclosure (Reg FD). 
My work posits a model of earnings that has many of the 
desirable properties of analyst forecasts, but less bias and is applicable to more firms and years.
This model is thus more useful to both researchers and practitioners.

\subsection{Univariate Results}

In the ``univariate'' equation above, $X_{t-1}$ is the lagged observation of a predictor. Table 
\ref{univariate-stats-eps} below shows summary statistics for the firm-level univariate 
regressions. 

Table \ref{univariate-stats-eps-rsquared} shows summary statistics for $R^2$ values of
these regressions. Predictors with high incremental $R^2$ values may be predictive in subsequent 
out-of-sample tests and the values may serve to limit the set of predictors. In particular, the 
lower in-sample explanatory power of $Accruals$ compared with $\Delta AP$ and $\Delta AR$ serve as
partial motivation for the former to be replaced by the latter two in the multivariate model.

\subsection{Earnings Forecasts}
To assess how the model performs by target year (the target firm's fiscal year end in which 
earnings will be announced), 
I compute mean squared prediction errors (MSPE) for all target years. The 
results in Table \ref{spe-by-year-table-fy1} show MSPE by target year for the model, mean analyst 
forecast, and median analyst forecast. All three estimates do extremely poorly during the dotcom
bubble bursting period. \footnote{MSPE comparisons for two-year-ahead and three-year-ahead 
forecasts have been omitted.}

\textbf{Does private information help analyst forecasts?} Table \ref{evaluation-regfd} presents
comparisons of the model's accuracy before and after implementation of Regulation Fair Disclosure. 
As noted in prior literature (e.g. \cite{gintschelmarkov2004}) analyst forecasts are worse in the 
post-Reg FD period. The performance of the model forecasts does not change in any consistent way
pre- and post-Reg FD.\footnote{In this section and all others, ``consensus'' forecasts refer to the
mean analyst estimate. Results with median analyst estimates are qualitatively similar.}


\textbf{The effects of \emph{ex ante} uncertainty on forecasts.} Table \ref{evaluation-dispersion}
presents comparisons of the accuracy of model and consensus forecasts during information 
environments characterized by high and low uncertainty. Both the model and analyst forecasts 
perform better during periods characterized by low analyst dispersion.\footnote{Dispersion is 
measured as the standard deviation of analyst forecasts. High (low) dispersion periods are those
with a standard deviation above (below) the median. Results are not sensitive to choice of 
percentile.} For the one-year-ahead forecasts, the model performs relatively better than consensus
forecasts.

\subsection{Earnings Forecasts as Trading Signals}
Most studies that compare time series forecasts to analyst forecasts use a loss function (evaluation
criterion) that is some form of relative prediction error or bias. To better quantify the 
significance of divergence between the consensus forecasts of earnings and the model forecast, I 
examine the returns
to an investor who uses the divergence in analyst and model forecasts as a signal. As a first step,
I calculate buy and hold returns ($BAHR$) for each firm from the forecast date to one month and, 
separately,
two months after the target date (i.e., the date at which forecasted earnings are revealed.) I do 
this for all forecasts (one-, two-, and three-year-ahead forecasts.) I then compute the divergence
between the model forecasts and the consensus forecast, $DIFF$, as the model forecast less the 
consensus forecast. $DIFF$ is calculated for each forecast horizon. For each forecast target and 
returns horizon I run a regression of the form

\begin{equation}
BAHR_{t+\tau} = \alpha_{0} + \alpha_{1}DIFF_{i} + \varepsilon.
\end{equation}

Table \ref{evaluation-bahr} shows the coefficient and p-values from each of these regressions. 
For the forecasts of FY1 earnings, buy-and-hold returns are positively and statistically 
significantly related to the degree of 
divergence between model forecasts and consensus analyst forecasts. Note, however, that
returns have not been adjusted for standard asset pricign risk factors.
\\

Next, I rank and group each forecast into deciles by the level of divergence. As Figures
\ref{bahr-diff-decile} and \ref{bahr-diff-decile2} show, the buy-and-hold returns over the forecast
horizon for the forecast of FY1 earnings is increasing in the level of divergence between the model
and the consensus forecast. This indicates that the stock returns of firms for which the model
forecasts higher earnings than analysts are higher than those for which analysts are more optimistic
than the model suggests.
